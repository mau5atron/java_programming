		All these types are signed, which means that they can hold either 
		positive or negative values. The type used for a variable depends 
		on the range of values it might need to hold. None of these integer
		variables can reliably store a value that is too large or too small 
		for its designed variable type, so take care when designating the 
		type. 
	*/ 


	/*
		Another type of number that can be stored is a floating-point number, 
		which has the type 'float' or 'double'. Floating-point numbebrs are 
		numbers with a decimal point. The 'float' type can handle any number 
		from 

				1.4E-45 to 3.4E+38
		, while the double type can be used for more precise numbers ranging 
		from 

			4.9E-324 to 1.7+308

		Because 'double' has more precision, that type generally is preferred

		The char type is used for individual characters, such as letters, 
		numbers, punctuation, and other symbols. 

		The last of the eight primitive data types is 'boolean'. 

		boolean primitives is either 'true' or 'false'

		ALL DATA TYPES

		type: 			size:				storable values: 

		byte 				8 bits 				-128 to 127
		
		short 			16 bits 			-32,768 to 32,767

															9,223,372,036,854,775,807s

		float 										1.4E-45 to 3.4E+38

		double 										4.9E-324 to 1.7+308

		char 

		boolean 									true or false
		

		void 											nothing
		/ void is the 9th data type, which represents nothing. 
		Used in methods to indicate that they do not return a value.
