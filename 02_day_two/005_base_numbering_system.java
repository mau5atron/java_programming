			Binary numbers are a base-2 numbering system in which only the 
			values 0 and 1 are used.

			Values made up of 1s and 0s are the simplest form for a computer
			and are a fundamental part of computing. Counting up from 0, 
			binary values are 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 111, and so on. 

			Each digit in the number is called a bit. The combination of eight numbers is a byte. A binary literal is specified by preceding it 
			with 0b, as in 0b101 for 101 (5 in decimal) and 
			0b01111111 (127)

			Octa numbers are a base-8 system, which means that they can represent only the values 0 through 7 as a single digit. The 
			eighth number in octal is 10. Octal literals begin with a 0, so 010
			is the decimal value 8, 012 is 9, and 020 is 16.

			Hecadecimal is a base-16 numbering system that can represent 16
			numbers as a single digit. The letters A through F represent the
			last 6 digits, so the first 16 numbers are 

			0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. 

			Hexadecimal literals begin with 0x, as on 0x12 (decimal 18) and
			0xFF(255).

			The octal and hexadecimal systems are better suited for certain

			ever edited a web page to set its background color, you could have
			used hexadecimal numbers for green (0x001100), blue(0x000011), or
			butterscotch(0xFFCC99).
