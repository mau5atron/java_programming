			Java is an object-oriented programming language. When you do work 
			in Java, you primarily use objects to get the job done. You create 
			objects, modify them, change their variables, call their methods, 
			and combine them with other objects. You develop classes, create
			objects out of those classes, and use them with other classes and
			objects. 

			Today, you work extensively with objects as you undertake these 
			essential tasks: 

			- Creating objects 
			- Testing and modifying their class and instance variables 
			- Calling an objects methods 
			- Converting objects from one class to another
