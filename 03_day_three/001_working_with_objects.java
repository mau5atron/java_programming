			Java is an object-oriented programming language. When you do work 
			in Java, you primarily use objects to get the job done. You create 
			objects, modify them, change their variables, call their methods, 
			and combine them with other objects. You develop classes, create
			objects out of those classes, and use them with other classes and
			objects. 

			Today, you work extensively with objects as you undertake these 
			essential tasks: 

			- Creating objects 
			- Testing and modifying their class and instance variables 
			- Calling an objects methods 
			- Converting objects from one class to another
		*/ 

		/*
			Creating new objects

			When you write a Java program, you define a set of classes. 
			As you learned during day 1, "Getting started with java", a class
			is a template use to create one or more objects. These objects 
			, which are also called INSTANCES, are self-contained elements of a 
			program with related features and data. For the most part, you use 
			the class merely to create instances and then work with those 
			instances. 
		*/ 

		/*
			When using strings during Day 2, "The ABCs of Programming", you 
			learned that a string literal (a series of characters enclosed in 
			double quotation marks) can be used to create a new instance of
			the class String with the value of that string.
		*/ 

		/*
			The String class is unusual in that respect. Although it's a class, 
			it can be assigned a value with a literal as if it was a primitive 
			data type. This shortcut is available only for strings and classes
			that represent primitive data types, such as Integer and Double.
			To create instances for all other classes, the new operator is 
			used. 
		*/ 

		/*
			Note: 

			What about the literals for numbers and characters? Don't they 
			create objects too? Actually, they don't. The primitive data types 
			for numbers and characters create numbers and characters, but for
			efficiency, they actually aren't objects. On Day 5, "Creating 
			Classes and Methods," you learn how to use objects to represent 
			primitive values.
